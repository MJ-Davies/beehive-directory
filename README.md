# CPSC 210 Personal Project: Beehive Directory
The application will contain a directory called honey. The hives will have an arbitrary number of hives with diverse fields including location, color of honey, primary pollen source, secondary pollen source, and any additional notes that may be unique to the hive. You will be able to add, remove, and edit hives where necessary and view all hives that are present in the system. There will be mandatory and optional fields that can be filled in, mandatory fields include color of honey and location. With the system, certain metrics can be obtained including the most common location of where hives reside in, how many hives have a specified color, filter by pollen source, and have it ordered in the directory view, etc.

This project is intended to be used by local Canadian farm markets, but it can also be used by hobby beekeepers or small businesses.

This project interests me because of my experience in beekeeping where I volunteered to manage 2 hives. This experience had me wondering how local markets manage to provide a wide variety of honey despite being situated in one location.
